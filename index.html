<h2>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</h2>

<p>
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it.
</p>

<p>
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"
</p>
<h2>Peter Pan</h2>

<p>
All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this.
</p>

<p>
Of course they lived at 14 [their house number on their street], and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one.
</p>
<h2>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</h2>

<p>
Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.
</p>

<p>
When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side.
